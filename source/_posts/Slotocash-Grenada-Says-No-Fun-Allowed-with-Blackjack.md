#  Slotocash Grenada Says No Fun Allowed with Blackjack

The Slotocash Grenada online casino has just announced that starting immediately, blackjack will no longer be available as a game option. This change comes after the casino determined that players were not using blackjack in the intended manner - instead of enjoying the game for its own sake, they were simply using it as a means to acquire more chips. In light of this behavior, and in an effort to ensure that all players are able to enjoy the games on offer, Slotocash Grenada has decided to remove blackjack from the list of options.

This news may come as a disappointment to some blackjack fans, but it is important to keep in mind that this decision was not made lightly. The Slotocash Grenada team is fully committed to providing an enjoyable gaming experience for all of their players, and they feel that this change is necessary in order to achieve that goal.

#  Casino slammed for blackjack denial in Grenada

The Casino at Grand Anse, Grenada has been criticised for refusing to allow a patron to play blackjack. The patron in question, 27-year-old Jason Charles, alleges that he was told by a casino employee that blackjack was not being offered on the night he visited.

Charles claims that this is the second time the casino has refused to offer blackjack. “I was so angry. I felt cheated. It’s like they were deliberately trying to stop me from playing,” Charles said in an interview with local media.

The Casino at Grand Anse has denied the allegations, stating that blackjack has never been offered at the casino and it has always been made clear to patrons what games are available on any given night.

This isn’t the first time a Caribbean casino has come under fire for denying players access to one of their most popular games. In 2014, two men filed a lawsuit against Princess Casino in Curacao after they were allegedly prevented from playing blackjack. The lawsuit was eventually thrown out of court.

Slotocash Grenada, a well-known casino located in the Spice Island of Grenada, is turning away blackjack players.

One such player, Kwasi Asare, said "I have been playing at Slotocash Grenada for a while now and I am really disappointed that they are no longer allowing blackjack players.

I understand that they are trying to improve their bottom line but this is not the way to do it.

I am going to take my business elsewhere."

#  Casino denies players their right to have fun with blackjack

Casino executives would like to remind players that blackjack is not a game meant for their enjoyment, but rather a method by which the casino can make money. Anyone caught having too much fun with the game may find themselves banned from playing at the casino in future.

“ Blackjack is not meant to be a fun game, it’s a serious business opportunity for the casino. We don’t tolerate players who try to make light of it, or who enjoy themselves too much. If you can’t take the game seriously, then you shouldn’t be playing it at all. ”

Some players feel that this policy is unfair, as they are not able to enjoy what is supposed to be a recreational activity. Others feel that casinos are within their rights to enforce these rules, as they are there to make money and not provide a venue for players to have fun. What do you think?
