#  Gambling Addiction is a Serious Problem

Gambling addiction is one of the most serious problems a person can have. It can lead to financial ruin, destroyed relationships, and even suicide.

Gambling addiction is a type of impulse control disorder. The person cannot resist the temptation to gamble, even though they know the risks.

People with gambling addiction often start out gambling recreationally. But over time, they need to gamble more and more to get the same rush. They may begin to lie or steal to get money to gamble with.

Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for the person's health and well-being. Financial problems are common, as is depression and other mental health issues. Gambling can also lead to risky behaviour, such as unsafe sex or drug use.

If you think you or someone you know has a gambling addiction, there is help available. Treatment options include counselling and medication.
