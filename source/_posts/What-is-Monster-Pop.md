#  What is Monster Pop Kentucky?

Monster Pop Kentucky is a new, independently produced monster movie filmed in Kentucky. The film is the brainchild of writer/director Jason Horton, who also stars in the lead role. The cast and crew of Monster Pop Kentucky are all volunteers with no experience in filmmaking prior to this project.

The film tells the story of a small town that is terrorized by a series of bizarre murders. The Sheriff (Horton) and his Deputy (Michael Wilbanks) must solve the murders before the townspeople lose all hope.

The Monster Pop Kentucky team has been working on the film since January 2014 and is currently in post-production. We are aiming for a summer 2015 release.

#  How to play Monster Pop?

Monster Pop is an addictive, fast paced matching game with a fresh new look. The objective is to clear the board of all the monsters by linking three or more of the same type together.

The game begins with a selection of different colored monsters displayed on the grid. Drag your finger over adjacent monsters of the same color to create a chain and they will disappear. Keep clearing the board until all the monsters are gone to complete the level.

If you get stuck, there are some bonuses available to help you out. The bomb bonus will clear a large area, while the color bomb bonus will change all adjacent monsters to the same color. There are also Time Bombs available which will detonate after a set amount of time, so use them wisely!

Your progress is saved automatically, so you can come back and finish up later. Monster Pop is free to play, but some in-game items such as extra bombs can be purchased for real money. If you don't want to use this feature, please disable in-app purchases in your device's settings.
