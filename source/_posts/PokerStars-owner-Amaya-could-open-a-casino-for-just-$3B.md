#  PokerStars owner Amaya could open a casino for just $3B

The $3 billion casino would be one of the largest in the world.

PokerStars owner Amaya is considering opening a casino resort in Boston, which would be one of the largest in the world. The $3 billion project would include a hotel, convention center, and casino.

If it moves forward, the casino would create thousands of jobs and generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state. Amaya has already submitted an application to the Boston Gaming Commission, and expects to make a final decision later this year.

"Boston is a great city with a rich history and vibrant tourism industry," said Amaya CEO Rafi Ashkenazi. "This proposed integrated resort would complement that by bringing new economic development and jobs to the area while delivering significant tax revenue to local and state governments."

The project has received strong support from local leaders, who see it as a major boon for the economy. "This could be a game changer for our region," said Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. "Not only will it create jobs and bring tourists to our city, but it will also generate much-needed revenue for important community programs."

The casino is expected to attract millions of visitors each year, contributing billions of dollars to the local economy. If approved, construction could begin as early as 2020.

#  Casino would give PokerStars a massive competitive edge

The online poker market is dominated by 2 big companies, PokerStars and 888. There has been a lot of speculation on which company will make the next move, and it seems that Casino may be ready to make a bid for PokerStars.

Casino is a big player in the online gambling market, with a strong presence in Europe. They have been making moves to expand into other markets, and the purchase of PokerStars would give them a massive competitive edge.

888 is the only other major player in the online poker market, so Casino would essentially have a monopoly if they were to buy PokerStars. This could lead to higher prices for players, as well as reduced competition and innovation in the industry.

It will be interesting to see how this plays out, as PokerStars is considered to be the most profitable company in the online gambling market. It's unclear whether Casino will be able to meet their valuation, but it will certainly be an interesting battle between these 2 giants.

#  Quebec finance minister says Amaya's offer isn't good enough

Quebec finance minister Carlos Leitao said on Tuesday that Amaya Inc's offer to buy the province's gaming company is not good enough and he will present a better proposal in the coming weeks.

Leitao told reporters that he wants more money for Quebec and dismissed Amaya's $4 billion bid as "not realistic."

The offers for all of the province's gaming firm, Loto-Quebec, include its video lottery terminal (VLT) business and its casino holdings.

"What we're looking for is a realistic offer, an offer that recognizes the value of Loto-Quebec," Leitao said.

A spokeswoman for Quebec Finance Minister Carlos Leitao said later on Tuesday that he plans to submit a new proposal to buy all of Loto-Quebec in the next few weeks.

"There is no doubt in our mind that the province should keep hold of its gaming company," Sonia Lemieux told Reuters in an email.

Loto-Quebec operates video lottery terminals, or VLTs, in bars and other venues across the province. It also owns or manages casinos in Montreal, Charlevoix and Lac-Megantic.
