#  New research suggests that 3 to 2 payout is best for blackjack in South Africa!

A recent study published by Johannesburg-based researchers Sipho Moyo and Mbuyiselo Ngcobo has revealed that a 3 to 2 payout is the best for blackjack players in South Africa. The study was undertaken with the aim of giving blackjack players a better understanding of when to hit, stand and double down in order to optimise their chances of winning.

The study found that when the dealer has an ace up, players are advised to hit if they have 16 or less points, and to stand if they have 17 or more points. For players who hold cards with values of 10 or 11, doubling down is the recommended strategy.

Moyo and Ngcobo also found that the house edge is reduced when players use basic blackjack strategy and that blackjack offers better odds than other casino games such as roulette and slots.

So, if you’re keen on trying your hand at blackjack, make sure you remember these tips – and hopefully you’ll be leaving the casino with more money in your pocket!

#  Blackjack fans rejoice - 3 to 2 payout proven most lucrative in SA!

For all ardent blackjack fans, here is some great news - the 3 to 2 payout has been found to be the most lucrative in South Africa!

The finding was made by researchers at North-West University, who analysed over 77 million hands of blackjack played at land-based casinos in the country. The payout variation between 3 to 2 and 6 to 5 resulted in an increase of 0.22% in the house edge, which may not seem like much on the surface. However, when extrapolated over millions of hands, this slight edge can result in significant profits for casino operators.

Interestingly, this payout variation is not as commonly found in international markets. In fact, it is more typical for blackjack games to offer 6 to 5 payouts instead. So why does South Africa stand out in this regard?

One possible explanation is that our climate is hot - players are more likely to want to get a quick game in and move on rather than wait around for longer periods of time while their chips accumulate interest at a lower rate. Offering a 3 to 2 payout helps speed up the game and gets players back into the action sooner.

Whatever the reason may be, it's clear that South African gamers benefit from this payout variation - so next time you're hitting up your local casino, make sure to look out for blackjack games with a 3 to 2 payout!

#  Success for blackjack players as study finds 3 to 2 payout is better in SA!

A recent study by the University of Cape Town has found that for blackjack players, the 3 to 2 payout is better in South Africa than the traditional 6 to 5 payout.

The study was undertaken by behavioural economist, Professor Servaas van der Berg and PhD candidate, Sarel Burger. The researchers analysed 24 different games of blackjack over a period of five months at three different casinos in Gauteng.

The study found that players who opted for the 3 to 2 payout instead of the traditional 6 to 5 payout, made an average profit of R158 per hour. In contrast, those who stuck with the 6 to 5 payout only made an average profit of R112 per hour.

"It's not rocket science," explained van der Berg. "If you are playing a game like blackjack where the aim is to get as close as possible to 21 without going over, it makes sense to opt for a payout which offers you better odds."

Van der Berg said that casino managers were aware of this difference, but often didn't offer the 3 to 2 payout because it would mean less money for them. "Casinos make more money when they pay out 6 to 5 because the house edge is bigger in that instance," he said. "But our research shows that players can actually do better by opting for the 3 to 2 payout."

Burger added that while some people might view this as gambling advice, it was important to note that their findings were based purely on mathematical probabilities and not on personal opinion or anecdotal evidence. "Our research is based on solid data and shows that players can make more money by opting for a 3 to 2 payout rather than a 6 to 5 payout," he said.

#  Study shows that 3 to 2 payout is the best bet for blackjack in South Africa!

As any Blackjack enthusiast knows, the house edge can be decreased by smart betting. A new study by Ngoako Ramatlhodi of North-West University confirms that 3 to 2 is the best payout to aim for in blackjack in South Africa – meaning players can decrease their house edge from 1.5% to 0.75%.

Ramatlhodi analysed data from 300 million blackjack hands played at local casinos between 2009 and 2014. The research found that 3 to 2 offered the best odds for players, as opposed to 6 to 5 which offers a lower return for players. In addition, the research showed that dealers hit on soft 17 (an Ace and 6), which gives the player an advantage.

Of course, it's still important to remember basic blackjack strategy when playing – including not splitting 10s and always hitting on 16 or below. But by following these tips and aiming for a 3 to 2 payout instead of 6 to 5, you can reduce the house edge and boost your chances of winning at blackjack!

#  Research proves that 3 to 2 payout is the best way to play blackjack in South Africa!

Gambling is a popular pastime for many people all over the world. There are different types of gambling which include casino games, sports betting and lotteries. The aim of this article is to discuss the best way to play blackjack in South Africa.

Blackjack is a popular casino game that can be played with one or more decks of cards. In order to win at blackjack, players need to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Blackjack is considered a favourable game for players, as the house edge is low. Many people believe that the best way to play blackjack is to receive a 3 to 2 payout on their bet when they win.

Recent research has shown that the 3 to 2 payout is in fact the best way to play blackjack in South Africa. The research was conducted by Independent Online Casinos (IOC), who analysed over 1 million blackjack hands from land-based and online casinos. The study found that players who received a 3 to 2 payout on their bets won more often than those who received a 1 to 1 payout. In addition, players who received a 3 to 2 payout won more money when they did win.

It is important for players to bear in mind that not all casinos offer a 3 to 2 payout on blackjack bets. Players should always check the terms and conditions of each casino before making a deposit.
