One of the main risks is that the recorder could interfere with your ability to drive safely.

If you are involved in an accident and your recorder captures the footage, the other driver could use it as evidence against you.\n\n#  What should I consider before purchasing an HD driving recorder?\n\nThere are a few things you should consider before purchasing an HD driving recorder. The first is what your needs are. Some people just want a basic recorder that will save footage in the event of an accident, while others may want a more advanced model that can also track their speed and location.\n\nAnother thing to consider is price. HD driving recorders can range in price from around $50 to several hundred dollars. It's important to decide what you're willing to spend and find a model that fits your budget.\n\nFinally, you'll need to decide on the features you want.

For these cases, you would need an HD driving recorder.</p>\n<p>These devices come in all shapes and sizes, but they all essentially do the same job.

This unit has a 2.7-inch screen and records in full 1080p HD. It also has Wi-Fi capabilities so that you can easily transfer files to your computer or mobile device.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a cheaper option, the YI Dash Camera might be a good choice for you. This camera records in full HD at 1080p 30fps and has a wide-angle lens to capture more of the scene around your car. It also comes with loop recording and G-sensor technology to protect your videos from being overwritten in the event of a collision or sudden impact.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-are-the-benefits-of-using-an-HD-driving-recorder-1\"><a href=\"#What-are-the-benefits-of-using-an-HD-driving-recorder-1\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What are the benefits of using an HD driving recorder?\"></a>What are the benefits of using an HD driving recorder?</h1><p>There are many benefits of using an HD driving recorder.
