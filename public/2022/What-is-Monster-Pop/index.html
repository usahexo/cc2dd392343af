<p>The Monster Pop Kentucky team has been working on the film since January 2014 and is currently in post-production. We are aiming for a summer 2015 release.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-play-Monster-Pop"><a href="#How-to-play-Monster-Pop" class="headerlink" title="How to play Monster Pop?"></a>How to play Monster Pop?</h1><p>Monster Pop is an addictive, fast paced matching game with a fresh new look. The objective is to clear the board of all the monsters by linking three or more of the same type together.</p>
<p>The game begins with a selection of different colored monsters displayed on the grid. Drag your finger over adjacent monsters of the same color to create a chain and they will disappear. Keep clearing the board until all the monsters are gone to complete the level.</p>
<p>If you get stuck, there are some bonuses available to help you out. The bomb bonus will clear a large area, while the color bomb bonus will change all adjacent monsters to the same color. There are also Time Bombs available which will detonate after a set amount of time, so use them wisely!</p>
<p>Your progress is saved automatically, so you can come back and finish up later. Monster Pop is free to play, but some in-game items such as extra bombs can be purchased for real money. If you don’t want to use this feature, please disable in-app purchases in your device’s settings.</p>
