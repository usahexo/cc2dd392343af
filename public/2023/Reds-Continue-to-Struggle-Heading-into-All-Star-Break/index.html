            <h1 id="Reds-Continue-to-Struggle-Heading-into-All-Star-Break"><a href="#Reds-Continue-to-Struggle-Heading-into-All-Star-Break" class="headerlink" title="Reds Continue to Struggle Heading into All-Star Break"></a>Reds Continue to Struggle Heading into All-Star Break</h1><p>The Cincinnati Reds season has not gone as planned so far. After a hot start, they have since cooled off and find themselves in last place in the National League Central Division. They continue to struggle offensively, and their bullpen has also been a problem.</p>
<p>There have been some bright spots, such as Joey Votto and Eugenio Suarez both having great seasons. Rookie Jesse Winker has also played well, providing a spark at the top of the lineup. Sonny Gray has also been a bright spot in the starting rotation.</p>
<p>However, there are still many questions that need to be answered for this team. Can they turn things around in time to make a playoff run? Or will they miss the playoffs for the fourth consecutive year?</p>
<p>There is still time for the Reds to make a run, but they will need to start playing better very soon. The All-Star break should give them a chance to regroup and come back stronger than ever.</p>
<h1 id="Bettors-Jump-on-Reds-Following-3-Game-Winning-Streak"><a href="#Bettors-Jump-on-Reds-Following-3-Game-Winning-Streak" class="headerlink" title="Bettors Jump on Reds Following 3-Game Winning Streak"></a>Bettors Jump on Reds Following 3-Game Winning Streak</h1><p>The Cincinnati Reds (39-40) have won their past three games, helping to improve their record and put them back into contention for a playoff spot. Bettors have taken notice, with the team’s odds of winning the World Series improving from +4000 to +3300 at sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com. </p>
<p>The Reds opened their current winning streak with a 7-2 victory over the Miami Marlins on June 25, followed by back-to-back wins over the Milwaukee Brewers. The Brewers are in first place in the National League Central division, but the Reds were able to take two of three games from them. </p>
<p>One of the reasons for Cincinnati’s recent success has been its bullpen. The team’s relief pitchers have a combined 2.12 ERA during the winning streak, allowing just six earned runs in 24 innings pitched. Closer Raisel Iglesias has been particularly impressive, converting all seven of his save opportunities while posting an ERA of 0.00 during that stretch. </p>
<p>Overall, Cincinnati ranks fifth in the National League in bullpen ERA (3.54), led by Iglesias and Michael Lorenzen (2.75). The starting rotation has also been solid, with Sonny Gray (3.38 ERA) and Luis Castillo (3.43 ERA) leading the way. </p>
<p>The Reds will look to continue their winning ways this week with a four-game series against the Atlanta Braves beginning on Tuesday. Cincinnati is currently 5½ games back of Milwaukee for first place in the division, but there is still plenty of time for them to make up ground. </p>
<p>If you are looking for some value on the Reds as they continue their hot streak, consider betting on them to win the World Series at +3300 odds at sportsbooks such as OddsShark.com</p>
<h1 id="Over-x2F-Under-Picks-for-Cincinnati-Reds-vs-Colorado-Rockies"><a href="#Over-x2F-Under-Picks-for-Cincinnati-Reds-vs-Colorado-Rockies" class="headerlink" title="Over&#x2F;Under Picks for Cincinnati Reds vs Colorado Rockies"></a>Over&#x2F;Under Picks for Cincinnati Reds vs Colorado Rockies</h1><p>The Cincinnati Reds (22-32) and Colorado Rockies (25-29) face off at Great American Ball Park on Tuesday night. The teams have faced each other 12 times in history, with the Rockies winning six of those games.</p>
<p>The Rockies will send Kyle Freeland to the mound on Tuesday night. The lefty is 4-5 with a 3.31 ERA this season. He has allowed just two earned runs over his last two starts, spanning 13 innings pitched. In his only start against the Reds, Freeland allowed one run over six innings pitched.</p>
<p>The Reds will send Tanner Roark to the mound on Tuesday night. The righty is 4-6 with a 4.60 ERA this season. He has allowed at least four earned runs in each of his last three starts, spanning 14 innings pitched. In his only start against the Rockies, Roark allowed five runs over six innings pitched.</p>
<p>Colorado is listed as a -115 favorite in this game, meaning that bettors must risk $115 to win $100 on a Colorado victory. The over&#x2F;under for this game is set at 10.5 runs.</p>
<p>I like the Rockies to win in this matchup. Freeland has been pitching very well lately and I don’t see the Reds being able to score many runs against him. I also like the over in this game, as I expect both teams to score some runs</p>
<h1 id="Cincinnati-Reds’-Struggles-Could-Lead-to-Changes-in-Management"><a href="#Cincinnati-Reds’-Struggles-Could-Lead-to-Changes-in-Management" class="headerlink" title="Cincinnati Reds’ Struggles Could Lead to Changes in Management"></a>Cincinnati Reds’ Struggles Could Lead to Changes in Management</h1><p>The Cincinnati Reds have had a tough season, and it could lead to changes in the team’s management. The Reds are in last place in the National League Central Division, with a record of 26-46. They are 14 games behind the first-place Milwaukee Brewers.</p>
<p>Team owner Bob Castellini is reportedly considering firing manager Bryan Price and general manager Dick Williams. The Reds have had just one winning season under Price, and they are on track for their third consecutive losing season.</p>
<p>Williams has been criticized for his decisions in the trade market. He has traded away key players such as Jay Bruce, Johnny Cueto and Aroldis Chapman, and the team has not been able to replace them adequately.</p>
<p>The Reds have some good young players, such as Joey Votto and Eugenio Suarez, but they may not be able to turn things around unless there are some major changes in the management of the team.</p>
<h1 id="MLB-Betting-Odds-Cincinnati-Reds-vs-Milwaukee-Brewers"><a href="#MLB-Betting-Odds-Cincinnati-Reds-vs-Milwaukee-Brewers" class="headerlink" title="MLB Betting Odds: Cincinnati Reds vs Milwaukee Brewers"></a>MLB Betting Odds: Cincinnati Reds vs Milwaukee Brewers</h1><p>The Cincinnati Reds (21-23) will visit the Milwaukee Brewers (29-16) on Thursday. The Reds have lost two games in a row and six of their last ten games, while the Brewers have won four games in a row and seven of their last ten games.</p>
<p>The starting pitchers for Thursday’s game have not yet been announced. However, the odds for the game are currently listed as follows:</p>
<p>Brewers -175<br>Reds +155</p>
<p>The Brewers are favored to win on Thursday, with odds of -175. This means that a $175 bet on the Brewers would net a total profit of $100. Conversely, a $100 bet on the Reds would result in a total profit of $155 if they were to win.</p>
